# Python course
*This repository contains some exercises that I did at school for the Python 101 course.*

# Project 1
In this project, the goal is to create a MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions).

### Usage
1st: clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/RemyJrd/PythonCourse
2st: use it with: 

    `python app.py`
The program will run itself. Use it with "A", "a", "B", "b", "C", or "c".

### Test
the program can automatically test itself. 
The test can only ensure that questions and answers are rendomized.
